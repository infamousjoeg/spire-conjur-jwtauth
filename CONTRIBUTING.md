2. Use the "Feature Request" template.
3. Provide a detailed explanation of your suggestion and its use case.

### Submitting Code Changes

If you would like to make a code contribution:
1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. **Create a branch** for your changes:
